            <h3>A brief introduction</h3>
            <p>Greetings Visitor! My name is Anush B Nair, you can call me Anush. I hail from India and starting this fall I am attending IIT Chicago as a graduate student pursuing MS in Information Technology and Management. I have almost 3 years of work experience in Deloitte as a web applicaition functional and automation tester. 
                <br><br>As far as my web app skills are concerned, my HTML and CSS skills are intermediate. My javascript skills are at a novice level. For that reason I'm learning JS from youtube on the side.</p>

            <p>
            ITMD 541 is Web Application Foundations.In this course we will examine core web technologies that are integral in the 
            creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover 
            fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus 
            will be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with 
            HTML and CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with other services. Current 
            frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be explored.

            <em class="storyheader">This is my story thus far...</em><br><br>
            As far back as I can remember, curiosity has been my defining characteristic. I have always been intrigued by anything new, especially technology. Our house did not have a computer from the beginning and my first experience with a home computer only came about when I was in 4th grade. During that time it was my elder brother who actually used it, mostly for playing old video games like Dave and playing songs from questionable sources...<br><br>
