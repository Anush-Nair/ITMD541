                    <p>
                    ITMD 541 is Web Application Foundations.In this course we will examine core web technologies that are integral in the 
                    creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover 
                    fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus 
                    will be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with 
                    HTML and CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with other services. Current 
                    frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be explored.

                As far back as I can remember, curiosity has been my defining characteristic. I have always been intrigued by anything new, especially technology. Our house did not have a computer from the beginning and my first experience with a home computer only came about when I was in 4th grade. During that time it was my elder brother who actually used it, mostly for playing old video games like Dave and playing songs from questionable sources...<br><br><br>
